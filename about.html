            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Education originated as
                transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
                encompass new ideas such as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information,
                skills needed for the modern society, empathy and complex vocational skills. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. </p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> The International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) was created by UNESCO as a statistical
                    base to compare education systems. In 1997, it defined 7 levels of education and 25 fields, though
                    the fields were later separated out to form a different project. The current version ISCED 2011 has 9
                    rather than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education occurs in a structured environment whose explicit
                purpose is teaching students. Usually, formal education takes place in a school environment with
                classrooms of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject.</p>
